<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId359842"></a>Bad
pixel mapping</h3>





<p>Currently there is a shift of pixels on the detector which does not
correspond to the actual geometrical location, which is due to the
reading scheme of the LIRIS detector. However it is relatively simple
to correct and there exist a C routine for such purpose. </p>





<p class="iraf">It is also possible to perform the correction within lirisdr/IRAF using the task <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lcpixmap</span>. &nbsp; </p>







<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId379725"></a>Correction
of Cross-talk between quadrants</h3>





<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an effect of row cross-talk
between quadrants which produces
an uniform shading&nbsp;in the rows containing bright sources and also
in the corresponding rows of the other quadrants. The magnitude of this
shadow is around 1.5E-5 on the sum of the affected row. This effect can
be noticed when the detector is exposed to very bright sources in
imaging mode. The effect becomes very relevant &nbsp;in multi -object
spectroscopy, especially when bright sources, used as reference, are
combined with very faint targets. Special care must be taken if the
distance between them is around 128".&nbsp;</p>





<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently the LIRIS detector rows correspond to the spectral dispersion axis. </p>

within <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lirisdr</span> performs the correction of the row cross-talk. It is
recommended to do not correct the effect&nbsp; unless it affects
significantly the results.&nbsp; </p>





<br>





<h4>Bad
pixel mask</h4>





<p>

Different mask types may be created and combined to form a final mask. In
general bad pixels can be classified into three categories: </p>







<ul>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>hot pixels - these pixels show an enhanced level of counts
even
without receiving any illumination. The number of hot pixels increases
with the exposure time (nearly proportional to log(texp). The location
of hot pixels can be
well determined from dark frames taken with the same exposure time as
the science frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>warm pixels - these pixels appear as less sensitive units
with
respect to the average. &nbsp;</p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>cold or blind&nbsp; pixels - these pixels always
exhibit a very
low count level, appearing as dark spots in the detector.&nbsp;The
location of cold pixels can be well determined from flat-field or blank
sky frames.</p>





  </li>





</ul>







<p class="iraf"> The IRAF routine <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ccdmask</span> can be used to generate the masks starting from the appropiate images. </p>

to have illumination level around 8000-10000 ADUs. For the filters
covering the K band spectral range it is recommended to obtain bright
and dark frames of the same&nbsp;exposure time, in order to suppress
the possible thermal contamination of the telescope enviroment.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId830329"></a>Determination
of field&nbsp;distortion</h4>







<p>
The field distorsion can be determined using stars in the
images&nbsp; which are well calibrated astrometrically or using a
reference mask which can be inserted in the LIRIS focal plane. In the
second option we can determined a geometrical transformation which can
be applied to any frame. It has been checked that this transformation
is not very sensitive to the telescope position or instrument
orientation. Therefore a single transformation can be used.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId475129"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Sky subtraction</h4>









<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This
is the most crutial step in the data reduction of near infrared images.
The sky contribution has to be estimated and subtracted individually to
each pixel. Therefore it is very important to have a clean estimation
of such value. </span></span>&nbsp;Depending on the extension of the
target the sky images can be generated
from a set of dithered images whose pointing is very close to the
target position or from separated exposures pointing to a position far
from the field of interest (off beam).</p>




<p style="text-align: justify;">Broadly speaking the sky image is generated by taking the
median frame of a set of images, i.e. by looking pixel by pixel to the
median of all values, which discards those values receiving flux from the
objects. However, before
extracting the median, all
frames have to be set to a common level. Generally all images are set
to a common level by adding a zero offset. A scaling factor can also be
used to obtain the same effect, this option works better when the sky
background israpidly changing, like at the sunset or sunrise.
&nbsp; </p>







<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of dithered images, there
are three possibilities to obtain sky frames: combining all images to
form a single image, classified by run number and additional by
cycles.&nbsp;</p>





<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p class="iraf">There are two main parameters controlling the sky subtraction process. First, the parameter <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">subsky</span> controls which type of sky images will be generated. There are three options: <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">combsky</span>, will create the sky from the list of input images; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">usrsky</span>, will use a sky frame &nbsp;supplied by the user, or will generate from a list of images;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">none</span>, will not subtract any sky image.&nbsp;</p>

Removal of reset anomaly effect</h4>




<p>


In many cases several short exposure time images are taken in the same
dithern position and saved together after&nbsp; coaveraging.
&nbsp;In these cases images containing different gradient across
the quadrant are put together and the gradient cannot be removed after
sky subtraction. Therefore an additional correction is introduced, the
vertical gradient subtraction. This correction consists of subtracting
an average column across the whole detector, this average column is
obtained by fitting low order polynomial (a constant or a straight
line) along the rows.&nbsp; This correction can be&nbsp; done
either along the whole row or per quadrant.

<p><img style="width: 961px; height: 547px;" alt="" src="reset_anomaly.jpg"><br>







</p>







<p class="iraf" style="text-align: justify;">This effect can be corrected using the
task <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">licvgrad</span> within the package limage. The following parameters can
be modified:</p>

<h4>Field distortion correction</h4>





<div style="text-align: justify;">The field distortion must be
corrected in those cases when we are
interested in the objects located near the border of the field of view
or to have a good astrometric solution in the whole field of view.
The images have to be corrected before final coaddition since the field
distorsion is produced into each frame and because of the dithering
pattern it affects differently the same sky region as registered at
different locations on the instrument field of view.&nbsp;
</div>







<h4>

Offset determination</h4>







<p>

The offset computation can be either manually or
automatically.&nbsp;<br>




In the manual procedure the user has to select one or more stars in the
reference image, which is taken as the first image in the list of input images. Then
the user has to mark in the remaining frames the first selected star,
the stars selected will appear marked at the expected position on the
display.&nbsp;<br>




In the automatic procedure all star-like sources will be found in the
reference image, then the positions of these stars will be matched in
the rest of frames based on the expected offset for each image, which is computed from the coordinates writen in the header.</p>





<p class="iraf">The relevant parameters to perform the offset computation in the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither</span> task are <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">match</span>, which accepts the options <span style="font-style: italic;">"wcs"</span> for automatic determination; <span style="font-style: italic;">"manual"</span> but also the name of a <span style="font-style: italic;">file</span> containing two columns with the x and y offsets,&nbsp;previously determined. In case <span style="font-style: italic;">"wcs"</span> is selected, the parameter <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">adjshift</span>
have to set to yes if the offsets can be refined from star positions,
or no if the coordinates writen in the header will be blindly used.
&nbsp;</p>


<p class="iraf">The offsets are always in integer pixels to avoid interpolating original image values. &nbsp;  </p>







<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId841587"></a>Images
coaddition</h4>







<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span>All sky subtracted images
can be&nbsp; coadded, once the offsets are computed. The combination of
images is usually done by taking the average value (preferred to the
median) of every pixel covering a given sky position.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here
bad pixel masks are taken into account. Moreover during the
combination&nbsp; the images can be set to a common average or median
value, deviant pixels can be discarded by sigma clipping, or min/max
rejection. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p class="iraf">The parameters concerning image coaddition are <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither.zero</span> to add a zero offset to each image, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither.scale</span> to use a scaling factor.&nbsp; The parameters <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither.reject</span> permits to set rejection of pixels, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither.nlow</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ldedither.nhigh</span> to discard by min/max values a fraction of the input images.&nbsp;</p>

Mode</h2>

In spectroscopic mode the spectra are taken following a nodding
pattern, in which the target is located in two (ABBA) or three (ABC...)
different positions along the slit. In most cases the autoguider is
used during the observations, unless they are very short exposures of
bright sources.

illumination of the dome (preferred in the K band to avoid absorption

<p>The result of the previous step is a set of images with most of the sky emission subtracted, obtained as A<sub>i</sub>-B<sub>i</sub>, and B<sub>i</sub>-A<sub>i</sub>,
some intense sky lines residuals may still be present. The final
coadded image will be obtained by&nbsp;shifting and combining all these
images. Before doing this step, the curvature of the spectral lines has
to be corrected, and in some cases the curvature of the object traces.</p>

<p class="iraf">The &nbsp;routine which perform these steps within <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lspect</span> is called <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lspnodcomb</span>. The following parameters are available:</p>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0); font-weight: bold;">

</span>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId3783"></a>Wavelength
calibration</h4>







<p>The wavelength calibration has to be determined a priori from
calibration lamp spectra taken with the same instrument configuration
as the science frames. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="iraf" style="text-align: justify;">The routine <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lspnodcomb</span> looks for two parameters in order to perform the wavelength calibration. The parameter <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">trspec</span> indicates&nbsp;the name of file containing the calibration parameters and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">database</span>
is the directory where to find it. The calibration parameters must be
contained in a file with the format produced by the IRAF task <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">fitcoords</span>. The program <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">transform</span> is used internally to perform the correction.</p>



<p><br>





</p>





<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId955612"></a>Curvature
removal</h4>



<p style="text-align: justify;">The spectrum of a point source appears
curved onto the detector, this
effect has to be taken into account in order to extract the flux of any
source. In most cases the object spectrum shows a trace which can be
later used to extract the flux.&nbsp;In particular, for the case of
extended sources, the
curvature of the spectrum
has to be removed in order to have the spectrum aligned along detector
rows. There is a procedure defined in the telescope designed to obtain
the traces of point
sources along the&nbsp; spatial direction of the slit, which consists
of taking various spectra moving a bright star along the slit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="iraf" style="text-align: justify;">The routine <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lspnodcomb</span> corrects for the curvature if the name of the transformation file is given in the parameter <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">trspat</span>.  </p>







<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId333587"></a>
Offset determination</h4>



<p>



The offset computation can be done either manually or
automatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the manual procedure the user has to be determine previously the
offsets along the slit, a task like splot could be used. It is obvious
that the target traces must be well defined, which is not the case for
very faint&nbsp; or for pure emission lines objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the automatic procedure the offsets between different exposures
will be determined from the information writen in the header. In the
case of LIRIS at the WHT this information is usually good enough given
the good pointing of the telescope and the use of the autoguider.</p>

<p class="iraf">A file containing the offsets which are applied in the
automatic procedure can be obtained if the parameter shift is
especified. In the case of manual procedure an input shift file has to
be introduced in the parameter ishift.&nbsp;In the future there will an
option to do this process interactively within the task
lspnodcomb.&nbsp; </p>







<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId669304"></a>The&nbsp; coaddition by itself</h4>

<p>This is the final step before getting a final 2-D spectrum. The
basic thing to do here is shift and combine the sky subtracted spectra.
In the case of 2 point nodding the sky emission will be&nbsp; cancelled
by definition, however in the case of 3-point nodding there is some
residual due to the sky&nbsp; variability.&nbsp; In addition, it is
possible to introduce bad pixel masking, do rejection of deviant pixel
values. There is also a possibility to subtract residual sky lines by
fitting a low order polynomial along the spatial direction. This option
is mostly used when 3 point nodding was used.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="iraf">Within the task <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lspnodcomb</span> the mask file is given in the parameter <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">maskim</span>, the selection of rejection algorithms and its parameters is done inside the pset <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">combspc</span>. The subtraction of residual sky lines is selected by the parameter <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">doubles</span>.</p>

<br>

<h4>Extraction of the spectra </h4>

<p class="iraf">The extraction of the spectra is done with the task <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">apall</span>. The option <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">background</span>
must be set to none, since the spectrum has been already background
subtracted. Another background subtraction will introduce additional
noise in the data.</p>

<h4>Telluric correction</h4>

<p>In order to perform the telluric correction one needs to observe a
reference star close to the science target, at similar airmass and
close in time. The ideal situation is to have a reference star with a
featureless spectrum, like O or B spectral types. However these
spectral types are relatively difficult to find, the usual situation is
to select a A0V (Vega- type star) or G2V (solar type) closeby from the
Hipparcos database. In such cases the intrinsic &nbsp;spectrum of the
reference star is well known. In order to decontaminate of the stellar
spectral features, one first divides the observed spectrum by the
theoretical spectrum convolved to the same resolution of the current
observations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the reference stars are of A0V spectral type the best choice is
to use the routines described by Vacca et al, available as IDL
program.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><br>MULTIOBJECT SPECTROSCOPY<br>
