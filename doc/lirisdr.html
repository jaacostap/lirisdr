<h1>lirisdr - An IRAF package for LIRIS data reduction</h1>
<h2>The problem of observing in the near infrared range using
ground-based telescopes:</h2>
The main trouble to solve is the high background coming from the Earth
atmosphere, there are different terms of contribution: the OH emission
lines and the airglow produced in the high layers of the atmosphere
dominating in the H band, the thermal radiation originated at the
telescope and its environment, increasing as moving to the red extreme
of the K band. <br>
<br>
<h2>Initial steps:</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step is to subtract the bias level. Each
pixel of common infrared detectors are usually read following the
scheme: <span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">reset</span>-<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">read</span>-<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">integrate</span>-<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">read</span>.&nbsp; In general data are
stored after subtraction of the first read level.&nbsp; If this is not
the case one has to perform this step.<br>
Currently, in the case of LIRIS data&nbsp; there is a pixel mapping
problem which has to be corrected before any other processing steps.
There is a C routine which performs this correction for a single file.
This routine can also be called from IRAF for a list of files, for
example:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lirisdr&gt;</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">lcpixmap</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">@inframes "c" out=outframes</span>&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h2>Imaging mode<br>
</h2>
The most common observing mode is to follow a dithern pattern. The
reduction steps to be followed are: <br>
<ul>
  <li>flat-field correction</li>
  <li>subtraction of sky image</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>construct and subtract sky image</li>
  <li>correct vertical gradient</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>correct geometrical distorsion is required</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>combine sky subtracted images </li>
</ul>
An sky image can be obtained as the median value for each pixel from
the whole set of&nbsp; frames.&nbsp; <br>
The program which perform the whole process is called <span
